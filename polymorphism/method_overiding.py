"""
Method overriding is the process of redefining a parent classâ€™s 
method in a subclass.

In other words, if a subclass provides a specific implementation of 
a method that had already been defined in one of its parent classes, 
it is known as method overriding.

In method overriding:

** The method in the parent class is called the overridden method.
** The methods in the child classes are called the overriding methods.
